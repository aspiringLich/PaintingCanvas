# PaintingCanvas

## What is this?
 
This is a complete overhaul to the old graphics library used in our AP comp science class. It adds more shapes, more features, a *much* more robust and capable animation system, and more!

## Features

The default font is comic sans (important feature) (you're welcome).

This is a relatively capable library, and it has most of the features you would expect out of a canvas. You can draw shapes, rotate them, and move them around. If you would like a more complete overview of what this library is capable of, check out the [javadoc](https://aspiringlich.github.io/PaintingCanvas/paintingcanvas/package-summary.html).

## Simplicity First!

This library is designed to be as simple as possible, while still being somewhat robust. It's made to be simple enough for absolute beginners to use, but powerful and extensible enough to satisfy all the biggest nerds out there.

So don't complain about how the rendering runs completely asynchronously from the main thread.

## Examples

You can find various examples in `src/test/java/examples/`. These are all runnable, and they should give you a good idea of how to use the library, and give good *examples* (haha get it) of the library's capabilities.
