# PaintingCanvas

## What is this?
 
This is a complete overhaul to the old graphics library used in our AP comp science class. As well as adding new features, it's no longer terrible and flashy with the power of like 10 lines of code. 

## Features

The default font is comic sans (important feature) (you're welcome).

This is a relatively capable library, and it has most of the features you would expect out of a canvas. You can draw objects, rotate them, and animate them. It's not a terribly extensive system, but you shouldn't struggle to do something cool with it.

## Simplicity First!

This library is meant to replace another one, and thus it's API is relatively similar to its predecessor. It puts simplicity over robustness first, as this is meant to teach people who barely know how to code in a more interactive way. It's also meant to be modified to fit the specific lesson or project. 

So don't complain about how the rendering runs completely detached and asynchronously from the main thread.

And how the animation system is more of an animation scheduling system (we've argued over this to no end).
